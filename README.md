# How to use
In a terminal, use the follow command to execute etl pipeline:

`python process_data.py disaster_messages.csv disaster_categories.csv DisasterResponse.db`

The follow command will train your model:

`python train_classifier.py ../data/DisasterResponse.db classifier.pkl`

To run the app:

`python run.py`
